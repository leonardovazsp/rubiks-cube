## Learning and Decision-Making

This system integrates multiple approaches for decision making:

* **Supervised Learning**: Color and pose recognizers trained on cube images
* **Reinforcement Learning**: A policy trained from scratch to solve the cube using exploration and temporal rewards
* **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Used on top of the RL policy for sample-efficient pathfinding and evaluation

## Setup & Installation

### Raspberry Pi

```bash
cd raspberry-pi
python3 setup.py --server-type master --domain your-domain.ngrok.io --port 8000 --token your-ngrok-token
```

### Arduino

Upload the sketch in `arduino/driver.cpp` using Arduino IDE.

### Server

```bash
cd server
python3 api.py
```

For training:

```bash
python3 test_trainer.py
```

## Dataset Generation

Run the following to capture images and associated states:

```bash
python3 generate.py
```

Images and move metadata will be saved in the configured directory.

## Example: Solving the Cube

```python
from cube import Cube
cube = Cube()
cube.driver.activate()
cube.driver.set_delay(900)
cube.scramble(20)
cube.solve()
```
